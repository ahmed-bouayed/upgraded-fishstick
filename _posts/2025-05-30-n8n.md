## What is n8n?

n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that lets you connect different apps and services with custom logic, without writing code. It supports hundreds of integrations and allows you to automate repetitive tasks, data transfers, notifications, and more.

## Key Features
- **Open Source**: Self-hosted and free to use.
- **Visual Workflow Editor**: Drag-and-drop interface for building automations.
- **Extensible**: Supports custom JavaScript code and community nodes.
- **Integrations**: Connects with popular services like Slack, GitHub, Google Sheets, and many more.
- **Triggers & Schedulers**: Automate workflows based on events or schedules.

## Deploying n8n with Docker Compose

Below is a sample `docker-compose.yml` to quickly get n8n running:

```yaml
services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n
    container_name: n8n
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5678:5678"
    environment:
      - N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true
      - N8N_PORT=5678
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
      - ./local-files:/files

volumes:
  n8n_data:
```

Start the service with:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

## Accessing n8n

Once started, open [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678) in your browser. Youâ€™ll see the n8n editor UI, where you can start building workflows.

## Example: Creating a Simple Workflow
1. Click **New Workflow**.
2. Add a **Trigger** node (e.g., Webhook or Cron).
3. Add an **Action** node (e.g., Send Email, HTTP Request).
4. Connect the nodes and activate the workflow.

## Security Tips
- By default, n8n runs without authentication. Set up basic auth or use a reverse proxy for production.
- Restrict access to the port (as in the example, only localhost is exposed).
- Regularly back up your workflow data.
