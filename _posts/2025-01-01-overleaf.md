First, let's clone this git repository to your machine:

git clone https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit.git ./overleaf-toolkit

Next let's move into this directory:

cd ./overleaf-toolkit

Let's create our local configuration, by running bin/init:

bin/init

Starting Up
The Overleaf Toolkit uses docker compose to manage the overleaf docker containers. The toolkit provides a set of scripts which wrap docker compose, and take care of most of the details for you.

Let's start the docker services:

bin/up -d

Overleaf comes with TeXLive-basic preinstalled. In case you want to make any changes to the LaTeX packages, you can:

(Optional) A good strategy would be to upgrade the TeXlive installation to the full scheme as follows:

docker exec sharelatex tlmgr install scheme-full

Create the first admin account
In a browser, open http://localhost/launchpad. You should see a form with email and password fields. Fill these in with the credentials you want to use as the admin account, then click "Register".

Then click the link to go to the login page (http://localhost/login). Enter the credentials. Once you are logged in, you will be taken to a welcome page.

Click the green button at the bottom of the page to start using Overleaf.
