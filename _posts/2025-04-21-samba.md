## Introduction
To share a directory over the LAN on Ubuntu, the most common and user-friendly method is to use Samba, which allows you to share folders with Windows and other Linux systems easily. Here's a simple step-by-step guide:

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step: Share a Directory on LAN (Ubuntu with Samba)

### Install Samba
Open your terminal and run:
```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba
```
### Choose a Directory to Share
For example, if you want to share your ~/Shared folder:
```shell
mkdir -p ~/Shared
```
### Make sure your user owns the folder:
```shell
sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/Shared
```
### Backup Samba Config File
```shell
sudo mv /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.bk
```
### Add Samba Config File
Open the Samba configuration file:
```shell
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```
Scroll to the bottom and add this block:
```config
[SharedFolder]
   path = /home/YOUR_USERNAME/Shared
   browseable = yes
   writable = yes
   guest ok = yes
   read only = no
   force user = YOUR_USERNAME
```
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username.

### Set Samba Password (Optional but recommended)
You can add your user to Samba with:
```shell
sudo smbpasswd -a $USER
```
### Restart Samba
To apply the changes:
```shell
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```
### Allow Samba Through the Firewall (if enabled)
```shell
sudo ufw allow samba
```
## üîó Access the Shared Folder from Another Device
On Windows, open `\\YOUR_UBUNTU_IP\SharedFolder` in File Explorer.
On another Linux, use:
```shell
nautilus smb://YOUR_UBUNTU_IP/SharedFolder
```
Replace `YOUR_UBUNTU_IP` with the local IP of your Ubuntu system (you can find it with `ip a`).
