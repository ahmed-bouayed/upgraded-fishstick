## About Trivy

Trivy is a comprehensive and versatile security scanner. Trivy has scanners that look for security issues, and targets where it can find those issues.

**Targets (what Trivy can scan)**:

- Container Image
- Filesystem
- Git Repository (remote)
- Virtual Machine Image
- Kubernetes
- AWS

**Scanners (what Trivy can find there)**:

- OS packages and software dependencies in use (SBOM)
- Known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- IaC issues and misconfigurations
- Sensitive information and secrets
- Software licenses

**Severity Level**

The severity is taken from the selected data source since the severity from vendors is more accurate. Using CVE-2023-0464 as an example, while it is rated as "HIGH" in NVD, Red Hat has marked its 'Impact' as "Low". As a result, Trivy will display it as "Low".

The severity depends on the compile option, the default configuration, etc. NVD doesn't know how the vendor distributes the software. Red Hat evaluates the severity more accurately. That's why Trivy prefers vendor scores over NVD.

If the data source does not provide a severity, the severity is determined based on the CVSS score as follows:

**CVSS v3.0 Ratings**

| Base Score Range | Severity |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0.1-3.9 | Low |
| 4.0-6.9 | Medium |
| 7.0-8.9 | High |
| 9.0-10.0 | Critical |
