## What is Pi-hole?
Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole designed to block ads and trackers at the network level. By acting as your networkâ€™s DNS server, it intercepts and blocks queries to known ad domains, ensuring a cleaner, faster browsing experience.


## Why Use Docker for Pi-hole?
Docker simplifies deployment by isolating Pi-hole in a containerized environment. It ensures a consistent and manageable installation, which can be easily backed up, updated, or migrated.


## deployement pihole
### Prerequisites
- Docker Installed / docker-compose Installed
 
- Static IP Address

### Prepare Your Environment
```shell
mkdir -p ~/pihole
cd ~/pihole
```
### Create a docker-compose.yml File
```shell
nano docker-compose.yml
```
### Write the following content into a docker-compose.yml file

```yaml
services:
  pihole:
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    container_name: pihole
    network_mode: host  # Use host networking for optimal performance
    environment:
      TZ: "Etc/UTC"  # Replace with your time zone
      DHCP_ACTIVE: "false"  # Disable Pi-hole DHCP functionality
    volumes:
      - './etc-pihole:/etc/pihole'
      - './etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d'
    restart: unless-stopped
``` 
Save this file in your ~/pihole directory
### Deploy the Container
Start the Pi-hole container
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
### Verify Deployment
Confirm the container is running
```shell
docker ps
```
### setup password for admin
```shell
docker exec -it pihole  pihole -a -p
```
### Access the Pi-hole admin interface by opening your browser and navigating to
```text
http://<your-server-ip>/admin
```
## Troubleshooting
Review Container Logs
Inspect the Pi-hole container logs for errors
```shell
docker logs pihole
```

Confirm Port Availability
Ensure that port 53 (DNS) is not occupied by another service

```shell
sudo ss -tuln | grep :53
```
Edit this file
```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
```
Change these lines
```text
DNS=127.0.0.1
DNSStubListener=no
```
Apply Updated Settings
```shell
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

## wildcard

Login to your pi-hole and go to `/etc/dnsmasq.d/`
Create a new file, lets call it `01-my-wildcard-dns.conf`
Edit the file, and add a line like this:
`address=/mydomain.lab/192.168.1.20`
Save the file, and exit the editor
Run the command: `service pihole-FTL restart`s
