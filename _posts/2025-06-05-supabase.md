## Introduction

Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service platform that provides developers with a suite of tools to build scalable and secure applications. It offers features like a PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage, and real-time subscriptions, making it a powerful alternative to Firebase. In this guide, we will walk you through setting up Supabase using Docker, configuring the environment, and getting started with its dashboard.

## Features of Supabase

- **PostgreSQL Database**: A fully managed PostgreSQL database with support for extensions.
- **Authentication**: Built-in user management and authentication.
- **Storage**: File storage with an API for managing files.
- **Real-time**: Real-time database updates using WebSockets.
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions for custom business logic.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Clone the Supabase Repository

```shell
# Get the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase
```

### 2. Create a New Project Directory

```shell
# Make your new supabase project directory
mkdir supabase-project

# Tree should look like this
# .
# ├── supabase
# └── supabase-project
```

### 3. Copy Configuration Files

```shell
# Copy the compose files over to your project
cp -rf supabase/docker/* supabase-project

# Copy the fake env vars
cp supabase/docker/.env.example supabase-project/.env
```

### 4. Navigate to Your Project Directory

```shell
# Switch to your project directory
cd supabase-project
```

### 5. Pull the Latest Docker Images

```shell
# Pull the latest images
docker compose pull
```

### 6. Start the Services

```shell
# Start the services (in detached mode)
docker compose up -d
```

### 7. Verify Running Services

After all the services have started, you can see them running in the background:

```shell
docker compose ps
```

## Configuring the Dashboard

The Supabase Dashboard is protected with basic authentication. Follow these steps to configure it:

1. Open the `./docker/.env` file in your project directory.
2. Update the following values:
```config
DASHBOARD_USERNAME: The default username for the Dashboard
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD: The default password for the Dashboard
```
3. To enable all dashboard features outside of localhost, update the following value:
```config
SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL: The URL or IP used to access the dashboard
```
4. Restart the services for the changes to take effect:

```shell
# Stop and remove the containers
docker compose down

# Recreate and start the containers
docker compose up -d
```

> Be aware that restarting services will result in downtime. Simply restarting the services does not apply configuration changes.
