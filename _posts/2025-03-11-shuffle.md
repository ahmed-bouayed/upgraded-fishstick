## What is Shuffle?
Shuffle is an open-source Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform. It enables security teams to automate workflows, integrate various security tools, and respond to threats more efficiently. With its drag-and-drop interface, Shuffle simplifies the process of building security automation without requiring extensive coding skills.
