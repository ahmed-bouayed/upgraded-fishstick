## What is Pi-hole?
Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole designed to block ads and trackers at the network level. By acting as your networkâ€™s DNS server, it intercepts and blocks queries to known ad domains, ensuring a cleaner, faster browsing experience.


## Why Use Docker for Pi-hole?
Docker simplifies deployment by isolating Pi-hole in a containerized environment. It ensures a consistent and manageable installation, which can be easily backed up, updated, or migrated.
