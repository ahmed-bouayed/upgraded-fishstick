Obtain an Activation Code

The first step in using Nessus Essentials is to obtain an activation code. Visit the [Nessus Activation Code Registration Page] (https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/activation-code) on Tenable’s website. Once there, register for Nessus Essentials by completing the registration form with your name, email address, and other required details. After submitting the form, Tenable will email you an activation code.
Create a Docker Compose File

Using Docker Compose makes it easier to manage your Docker containers. Create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content:
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  nessus-essentials:
    image: tenable/nessus:latest-ubuntu
    container_name: nessus-essentials
    ports:
      - "8834:8834"
    environment:
      - USERNAME=admin 
      - PASSWORD=admin
      - ACTIVATION_CODE=YOUR_ACTIVATION_CODE
    restart: unless-stopped
```
Replace YOUR_ACTIVATION_CODE with the code you received from Tenable. Also, make sure you set a secure USERNAME and PASSWORD.
Deploy Nessus Essentials

    Open a terminal window on your machine.
    Navigate to the directory where you saved your docker-compose.yml file.
    Run the following command to start the Nessus Essentials container: docker-compose up -d This command will download the Nessus Docker image (if not already available) and start the container in detached mode.

Access the Nessus Web Interface

    Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8834.
    Log in using the credentials specified in your docker-compose.yml file.
    Complete the initial setup:
        Follow the prompts to activate Nessus Essentials using the activation code.
        Then, configure any additional settings as needed.

Run a Basic Network Scan

    Go to the Scans tab in the Nessus web interface.
    Create a New Scan:
        Click on “New Scan”.
        Choose a scan template that suits your needs, such as “Basic Network Scan”.
        Then, provide a name for your scan and adjust any necessary settings.
    Set Up Scan Targets:
        Enter the IP addresses or network ranges you want to scan.
    Launch the Scan:
        Click “Save” to save your scan configuration.
        Click “Launch” to start the scan.
    Monitor the Scan:
        Track the scan progress and review the results from the Nessus web interface.
