```shell
# Get the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase

# Make your new supabase project directory
mkdir supabase-project

# Tree should look like this
# .
# ├── supabase
# └── supabase-project

# Copy the compose files over to your project
cp -rf supabase/docker/* supabase-project

# Copy the fake env vars
cp supabase/docker/.env.example supabase-project/.env

# Switch to your project directory
cd supabase-project

# Pull the latest images
docker compose pull

# Start the services (in detached mode)
docker compose up -d
```


After all the services have started you can see them running in the background:
```shell
docker compose ps
```


Dashboard authentication#
The Dashboard is protected with basic authentication. The default user and password MUST be updated before using Supabase in production.
Update the following values in the `./docker/.env` file:
```config
DASHBOARD_USERNAME: The default username for the Dashboard
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD: The default password for the Dashboard
```

To enable all dashboard features outside of localhost, update the following value in the `./docker/.env` file:

`SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL`: The URL or IP used to access the dashboard

You will need to `restart` the services for the changes to take effect.

Restarting all services#
You can restart services to pick up any configuration changes by running:
```yaml
# Stop and remove the containers
docker compose down
# Recreate and start the containers
docker compose up -d
```
Be aware that this will result in downtime. Simply restarting the services does not apply configuration changes.
