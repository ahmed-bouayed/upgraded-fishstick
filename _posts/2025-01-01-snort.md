Step 1: Update Your System
First, ensure your system is up to date:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
Step 2: Install Snort
You can install Snort directly from the Ubuntu repositories:

sudo apt install snort -y

Step 3: Configure Snort
During the installation, you will be prompted to configure Snort. You'll need to provide the following information:

Network Address: Enter the IP address range of your network (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

Interface: Specify the network interface Snort should monitor (e.g., eth0).

Step 4: Verify the Installation
After installation, verify that Snort is installed correctly:

snort -V
This should display the version of Snort installed.

Step 5: Test Snort
You can run Snort in test mode to ensure it's working:

sudo snort -T -i <interface> -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
Replace <interface> with the network interface you specified during configuration (e.g., eth0).



sudo nano /etc/snort


sudo cp snort.conf snort.conf.backup



sudo nano snort.conf
